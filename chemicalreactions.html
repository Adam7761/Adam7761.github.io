    <h3 style="background-color: white;">Chemical Reactions</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Chemical reaction occurs when two or more molecules interact, and the result is that the molecules change. 
        What takes place is that the bonds between the atoms are broken and created to form new molecules.
        A better method of exampling chemical equations is looking at in the sense of practical changes that take place. For example, a refrigerator or air conditioner cools the air, there is no reaction in the air molecules. 
        The change in temperature is a physical change. When you melt an ice cube, it is a physical change. When you put bleach in the washing machine to clean your clothes, a chemical change breaks up the molecules in your stains.

        <h3 style="background-color: white;">Chemical Equations</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">The changes in chemical reactions can be modelled using word equations. 
            In general, to represent a chemical equation you would write reactants → products.
            The reactants are shown on the left of the arrow, and the products are shown on the right of the arrow. 
            Equations should not be written using an equal sign instead of an arrow. If there is more than one reactant or product, 
            they are separated by a plus sign.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> <br> The goal with chemical equations is to create a balanced equation. 
            Which will be used to give more information about a chemical reaction because it includes the symbols and formulae of the substances involved. 
            <br> <br>There are two steps in writing a balanced equation:
            <br>1.	replace the name of each substance with its symbol or formula
            <br>2.	use numbers to balance the equation, if it is not already balanced
            <br>In this example which is the reaction between copper and oxygen to make copper oxide. 
            <br><br>Cu + O2 → CuO<br><br>
            The equation is unbalanced because there is one copper atom on each side of the arrow, but two oxygen atoms on the left and only one on the right. To balance the equation, you need to adjust the number of units of some of the substances until we get equal numbers of each type of atom on both sides. 
            You should never change the formula of a substance to do this.
            <br><br>The balanced equation is:
            <br><br>2Cu + O2 → 2CuO<br><br>
            You can see that this is correct as there 2 elements to each side of the equation.
            If you are unsure if the equation is done correctly treat it as if was a weighing scale and 
            your tasked with ensuring the scale is perfectly balanced. If both the scale does not look correct 
            the likelyhood of it being wrong is high.

        <h3 style="background-color: white;">Combustion Reactions</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Combustion is which is a reaction caused by burning. Combustion reaction is an exothermic reaction, 
            that releases energy to the surroundings. 
            The energy released is mostly thermal energy, but light energy and sound energy are also released. 
            Even though it is a exothermix reaction there some other elements whos reactions are endothermic reactions 
            when means that they take in energy from their surroundings.

            <br><br>Combustion reaction requires three different elements to start:
            <br>1.	The first Element is Heat<br> 
            <br>2.	The second element is Oxygen<br> 
            <br>3.	The third element is Fuel<br>
            <br>If one of the elements is removed, a fire will not start, and a fire that is already burning will go out. A simple rule of thumb to remember when discussing combustion reaction is that. The fire will go out when the fuel runs out, but it is often unsafe to leave a fire that long. 
            Different types of fires need to be tackled in different ways.
            
            <br><br>There are two types of Combustion a complete combustion and an incomplete combustion:
            <br><br>Complete combustion<br><br>
            Complete combustion uses Coal, oil and natural gas are fuels that are widely used. They contain hydrocarbons, which are compounds of hydrogen and carbon only. When the fuel burns, its hydrocarbons react with oxygen. If there is plenty of air, complete combustion happens.
            <br><br>Incomplete combustion<br><br>
            Incomplete combustion occurs when there is not enough air or oxygen for complete combustion, incomplete combustion happens instead. Water vapour and carbon dioxide are still produced, but two other dangerous products are also produced. 
            The first being carbon monoxide, CO, a colourless toxic gas. The second being particles of carbon, which appear as soot and smoke, and which cause breathing problems.

        <h3 style="background-color: white; font-size: 26px; ">Thermal Decomposition</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Some compounds break down when heated, forming two or more products from one reactant. 
            This type of reaction is called thermal decomposition. 
            Thermal decomposition is an example of an endothermic reaction, which is a reaction that gains energy from the surroundings.
            A lot of metal carbonates can take part in thermal decomposition reactions. 

            For example, copper carbonate breaks down easily when it is heated as shown below in the equation:
            <br><br>copper carbonate → copper oxide + carbon dioxide<br>
            <br>CuCO3 → CuO + CO2<br>

        <h3 style="background-color: white;">Oxidation and Reduction</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Oxidation is the loss of electrons during a reaction by a molecule, atom or ion.
            Oxidation occurs when the oxidation state of a molecule, atom or ion is increased. 
            The opposite process is called reduction, which occurs when there is a gain of electrons or the oxidation state of an atom, molecule, or ion decreases.
            <br><br>An example of Oxidation and reduction in terms of oxygen transfer:<br>
            <br>Oxidation is gain of Oxygen.<br>
            <br>Reduction is loss of Oxygen.<br>
            <br>Because both reduction and oxidation are going on side-by-side, this is known as a redox reaction.
            <br>An oxidizing agent is substance which oxidizes something else<br><br>
            An oxidizing agent is substance which oxidizes something else. 
            In the above example, the iron oxide is the oxidizing agent. A reducing agent reduces something else.
            In the equation, the carbon monoxide is the reducing agent.
            Oxidizing agents give oxygen to another substance.
            Reducing agents remove oxygen from another substance.

        <h3 style="background-color: white;">Reactions and Catalysts</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">A catalyst is a substance that speeds up reactions and is not used up during the reaction its mass stays the same throughout the whole reaction and is chemically unchanged along with the mass of the catalyst after the reaction has finished. <br> <br> 
            Only a very small amount of catalyst is needed to increase the rate of the reaction between large amounts of reactants. Different catalysts are required to catalyse different reactions however not all reactions have catalysts. <br> <br>
            Catalysts only affect the rate of reaction they do not affect the yield of the reaction. A catalysed reaction produces the same amount of product as an uncatalyzed reaction, but it produces the product at a faster rate.
            Catalyst operate by providing an alternative reaction pathway that has a lower activation energy than the uncatalysed reaction. This does not change the frequency of collisions. However, it does increase the frequency of successful collisions because a greater proportion of collisions now exceeds this lower activation energy.
