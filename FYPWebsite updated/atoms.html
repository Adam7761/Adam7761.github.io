    <p style="font-size: 18px;"> Atoms are the basic units of matter and the defining structure of elements. The term "atom" comes from the Greek word for indivisible, 
        because it was once thought that atoms were the smallest things in the universe and could not be divided. We now know that atoms are made up of three particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. 
        These particles are composed of even smaller particles, such as quarks.</p>

    <h3 style="background: white;">Atomic Particles</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Protons and neutrons are heavier than electrons and reside in the nucleus at the centre of the atom. Electrons are extremely lightweight and exist in a cloud orbiting the nucleus. 
             Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass. Atoms always have an equal number of protons and electrons, and the number of protons and neutrons is usually the same as well. 
             Adding a proton to an atom makes a new element, while adding a neutron makes an isotope, or heavier version, of that atom.</p>
             <p style="font-size: 20px;">Quarks which are tiny particles that makes up protons and neutrons. Quarks can be used to measure how big an protons and neutrons are. There are six types of quarks. The types of quarks are called flavours. 
                There are 6 flavours which are up, down, strange, charm, top, and bottom. The Up, charm and top quarks have a charge of +2⁄3. Whereas the down, strange and bottom quarks have a charge of -1⁄3. 
                Each quark has a matching antiquark. Antiquarks have a charge opposite to that of their quarks; meaning that up, charm and top antiquarks have a charge of -2⁄3 and that down, strange, and bottom antiquarks have a charge of +1⁄3.</p>

        <h3 style="background: white;">Protons</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Protons are positively charged particles found within atomic nuclei. Rutherford discovered them in experiments with cathode-ray tubes that were conducted between 1911 and 1919. Protons are about 99.86% as massive as neutrons. 
                The number of protons in an atom is unique to each element. For example, carbon atoms have six protons, hydrogen atoms have one and oxygen atoms have eight. The number of protons in an atom is referred to as the atomic number of that element. 
                The number of protons also determines the chemical behaviour of the element. Elements are arranged in the Periodic Table of the Elements in order of increasing atomic number.
                Protons are made of three quarks. Which the Flavour are Two "UP" quarks (each with a two-thirds positive charge) and one "down" quark (with a one-third negative charge) and these quarks are held together by other subatomic particles called gluons, which are massless.

            <h3 style="background: white;">Nucleus</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;"> All the mass of an atom resides in its nucleus. The protons and neutrons that make up the nucleus are approximately the same mass with the proton being slightly less and they have the same angular momentum, or better known as spin. 
                The nucleus is held together by the strong force, one of the four basic forces in nature.
                This force between the protons and neutrons overcomes the repulsive electrical force that would otherwise push the protons apart, according to the rules of electricity. </p>

            <h3 style="background: white;">Electrons</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
                Electrons have a negative charge and are electrically attracted to the positively charged protons. Electrons are tiny compared to protons and neutrons they are, over 1,800 times smaller than either a proton or a neutron. Electrons are about 0.054% as big as neutrons.
                Electrons were discovered in 1897 by Joseph John (J.J.) Thomson, who was a British physicist and referred to them as "corpuscles,"
                That idea was than expanded upon in the 1920s by Erwin Schrödinger, who was an Austrian physicist. Who presented the idea that Electrons surround the atomic nucleus in pathways called orbitals. Today, this model is known as the quantum model or the electron cloud model. 
                The inner orbitals surrounding the atom are spherical, but the outer orbitals are much more complicated.</p>

            <h3 style="background: white;">Neutrons</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Neutrons were theorized to have existed as early as the 1920s research shows that a Rutherford had the initial concept. 
                This idea was than later expanded upon by when Chadwick discovered the Neutron in 1932. He discovered that Neutrons exist because of experiments where he shot atoms at a thin sheet of beryllium and the result was that were Subatomic particles with no charge were released. 
                So, appropriately named them Neutrons.
                The basic principle of Neutrons is that they are the particles in an atom that have a neutral charge and do not release a charge.
                Neutrons are uncharged particles found within all atomic nuclei (except for hydrogen). A neutron's mass is slightly larger than that of a proton.
                Like protons, neutrons are also made of quarks. The flavour of which are one "up" quark (with a positive 2/3 charge) and two "down" quarks (each with a negative one-third charge). </p>
